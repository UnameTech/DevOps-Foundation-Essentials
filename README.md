#  DevOps Foundation Essentials  
**Alternate Names:**  
_DevOps Starter Kit | DevOps Kickstart | Zero to DevOps | DevOps for Absolute Beginners_

---

##  Module Objective

To provide a **solid foundation** in the concepts, tools, and mindsets required to start a successful journey in DevOps ‚Äî especially for:

- Fresh graduates  
- Non-IT professionals transitioning to tech  
- Working professionals looking to shift into DevOps  

By the end of this module, learners will have built the **right mental model**, acquired **essential technical skills**, and gained a clear **roadmap for what comes next** in their DevOps learning.

---

##  Why This Module Is Essential

Most learners struggle when diving directly into DevOps tools like Jenkins or Kubernetes without understanding the **fundamentals** ‚Äî such as Linux, networking, version control, or the DevOps lifecycle itself.

This module fills that gap.

It builds the **conceptual clarity**, **technical confidence**, and **hands-on comfort** needed to succeed in later, more advanced DevOps topics.

##  Lesson Plan

---

### **Section 1: Understanding DevOps ‚Äì The Big Picture**

- What is DevOps, and why it exists  
- A real-world story: from code to production ‚Äî what really happens  
- DevOps lifecycle explained simply  
- Software development workflow overview  
- Who does what: developer, DevOps engineer, tester, SRE  
- Common DevOps roles and what companies expect  
- Key tools and practices used at each stage of a pipeline  
- DevOps vs SRE vs Cloud Engineer: who does what?

 Outcome: Learners gain clarity on where DevOps fits in the real world and what their future role could look like.

- Routing basics ‚Äì how packets find their way  
- Lab: Use `ping`, `curl`, `ip`, `ifconfig`, `netstat` to explore your network

 Outcome: Learners will no longer be afraid of IPs, ports, or DNS errors ‚Äî they'll understand what‚Äôs going on under the hood.

---

### **Section 4: Version Control Introduction ‚Äì Git & GitHub**

- Why tracking code is necessary (and what goes wrong without it)  
- What is Git?  
- Git vs GitHub ‚Äî explained clearly  
- How Git helps in collaboration  
- Local vs remote repositories  
- Lab:
