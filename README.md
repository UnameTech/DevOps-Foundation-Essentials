### How Everything Connects – Real World Analogy  

**The Pizza Delivery Analogy**  

Think of building and delivering software like running a pizza shop:

- **Version Control (Git)**: The recipe book where every change to a pizza recipe is tracked  
- **Jenkins (CI CD)**: The chef that prepares pizzas as soon as an order is placed  
- **Terraform (IaC)**: The person who sets up your kitchen and delivery counter  
- **Ansible (Configuration)**: The manager who configures ovens, lights, and other kitchen settings  
- **Docker**: The pizza box that safely packs the pizza  
- **Kubernetes**: The delivery manager that makes sure pizza boxes are efficiently delivered  
- **Cloud (AWS or Azure)**: The city where your pizza shop is located  
- **Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)**: The CCTV and feedback system that shows how fast deliveries are, how happy customers are, and if any oven is broken  

---

### What to Expect in the Next Modules  

- Learners will get step by step guidance on installing, using, and building real projects with these tools  
- Each tool will be introduced with hands-on labs, real-world use cases, and best practices  
- By the end, learners will be able to build a production grade CI CD pipeline and deploy applications on cloud
